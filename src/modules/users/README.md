## üìù User Stories

### 1. User Registration

**As a** new user  
**I want to** create an account  
**So that** I can access the system

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- User can provide email, name, and password
- Password is securely hashed
- Email must be unique and valid
- User receives confirmation of successful registration
- User can optionally be associated with a tenant during registration

### 2. User Profile Management

**As a** registered user  
**I want to** update my profile information  
**So that** my details are current

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- User can update their name
- User can update their email
- Changes are immediately reflected
- Only authenticated users can update their own profile
- Admins can update any user's profile

### 3. Password Change

**As a** registered user  
**I want to** change my password  
**So that** I can maintain account security

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- User must provide current password
- New password must meet security requirements
- Password change requires authentication
- User receives confirmation of successful password change
- Only authenticated users can change their own password

### 4. Tenant Association

**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** assign users to tenants  
**So that** users can access tenant-specific resources

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Admin can assign users to specific tenants
- Users can only be assigned to existing tenants

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Admin can assign multiple roles to a user
- Roles can be tenant-specific
- Role changes are immediately effective
- Users can have different roles for different tenants
- Only admins can modify role assignments

## üîí Security Considerations

- All endpoints require authentication
- Password changes require current password verification
- Users can only access their own resources unless they have admin/support roles
- Role-based access control is enforced at both endpoint and resource levels
- Sensitive operations (password changes, deletions) require additional verification

## üì¶ Dependencies

- PasswordService: For password hashing and verification
- TenantsService: For tenant validation and management
- RolesService: For role validation and management
- AuthService: For authentication and authorization
- AuthGuard: For endpoint protection
- CheckUserAccess: For resource-level authorization
